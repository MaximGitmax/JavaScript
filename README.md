# JavaScript

This Repo consists of my JavaScript practical tasks.

You can paste each js file in your development environment (intellij idea, VS Code), run the code and look into the output. Each file contains the comments.

<b>Repo files:</b>
  - JS_1 - first bundle of tasks, that a little bit connected with each other.
   
       - Tasks_1-30.js - 30 little tasks
       - Tasks_functions_if_else.js - few tasks that have connection with Tasks_1-30.js
       - JS+HTML - derives from Tasks_functions_if_else.js. Consists of files: JavaScript and HTML, that allow you to run an application in Browser, enter your age in Prompt and get the response, corresponding to the entered data, on the HTML page.  
       
  - JS_2 
  
       - Tasks_Algorithms.js - training algorithms.
